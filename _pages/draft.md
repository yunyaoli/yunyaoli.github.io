### We Can't Do it Alone**
#### Leon Derczynsk
* <small>**Abstract:** Industry and academic research each have their own deficiences and blindspots, and both rely heavily on each other. This talk explores common themes and describes each side's view and what they miss for each theme. We will discuss the role in society, the role in research, which narratives work (and don't), the role in peer review (and its role for us), and where the hard workers, sceptics, and sociopaths fit in either case. All this comes together to form a positive view of good open collaborations, and some concrete advice on how to give and get the most value out of interactions with the other side.</small>

* <small>**Bio:** Leon Derczynski is principal research scientist for LLM security at NVIDIA and prof in computer science at ITU Copenhagen. He was written inches, if not kilograms, of papers, and won similar quantities of awards etc. Prof. Derczynski has led policy efforts in academia, industry, and civil society. He has held affiliations at a dozen organisations in the past decade, including startups, universities, corporations, and non-profits; built research programmes at both a leading university and a leading corporation; and he retains a deep love of both university and industry research.
